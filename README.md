# gradec

`gradec` accumulates [score comments](#score-comments) on a GitHub commit, and
then comments the final score on the commit. `gradec` can also comment a
commit's CI build, and retrieve the score of a commit at a later time.

`gradec` is designed to run on a batch of commits to grade. See [its
usage](#usage) for more information.

## Installation

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as a dependency manager and build
runner. After cloning the repo, install the project's dependencies and install
the global `gradec` command.

```shell
yarn install
yarn install-global
```

To run `gradec`, you will neeed to get a
[GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
and export a **GRADEC_ACCESS_TOKEN** environment variable with the value of that
token. Set the variable in your `.bashrc` or similar if you want to avoid
repeating this for every shell instance.

#### Score comments

`gradec` calculates the grade/score of an assignment by accumulating _score comments_ on a commit.
Score comments have the (regex) grammar

```regex
([+|-]\d+)(:.*)?
```

where only the first capturing group is used in accumultating the total score.

Score comments:

- `+3: nice!` (+3 to score)
- `-2: consider...` (-2 to score)
- `-1` (-1 to score)

Not score comments:

- `observation...` (+0 to score)
- `3` (+0 to score)
- `-` (+0 to score)

#### Partial grading

`gradec` has particular behavior for assignments that are in the process of or
have been graded:

1. Assignments that `gradec` has graded in the past are not included as needing
   to be graded.
2. Assignments for which `gradec` has previously commented a CI tests link tests
   are not issued a new CI tests link comment.

## Development

Please lint, format, and test your code after development. There are no
pre-commit hooks, so this is mostly on an honor system.

This project uses [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/),
[clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html), and
[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) as a linter, automated formatter, and test
framework, respectively. `tslint` and `jasmine` are installed with the project
dependencies; `clang-format` must be installed separately.

```shell
yarn format
yarn lint
yarn lint:fix # apply some automated linting fixes
yarn test
```
